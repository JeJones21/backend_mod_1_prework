## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
- I felt attacked LOL. I felt like those blogs were written for me. I wait too long to ask for help or ask questions bc I felt behind compared to the class due to trying to work too much. Asking for help is hard for my but after reading these articles, I realize there is no room for pride in this program. I am currently behind on prework due to me being too damn shy to ask for help and taking way too long on each problem. Lesson learned.

### If Statements

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
 - conditional statements evaluate whether the code is true or false.
 examples) IF, ELSIF, ELSE.

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
 - To decide whether or not to run the code/to make decisions
 - Starts a branch

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
 - if (condition) instruction

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
 - elsif and else

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
 ```
    if movie == 'funny'
        puts "hahaha"
    elsif movie == 'sad'
        puts "I cried alot"
    else
        puts "did you even watch it?"
    end
 ```
1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
 # true false, yes no? unsure what this question is saying.

### Methods

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
 - purpose of a method is to save time, not repeatedly typing the same code. It is a saved function.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
 ```
    def hello
      puts "Sam I am"
    end

    hello
```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
 ```
    def hello_someone(name)
      puts "#{name} I am"
    end

    hello_someone("JJ")
```


1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
 hello_someone("JJ")

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
 not a question but the math puzzle was definitely a brain buster.
 also struggled with 10 ways to call it? Got to practice that more.
