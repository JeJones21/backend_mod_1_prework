## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

 - I didn't know there was a name for the way I was feeling!
 - I always would say I had a growth mindset but when it came to starting Turing I was fixed fixed *FIXED*
 - Those with a GM keep going when hard and accept critical feedback. I would say get the tough stuff done with optimism and    mastery.
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
 - I currently have a GM in the way that I took the biggest risk of my life, "quit my job of 14.5 years after buying a house" to go to Turing.
 - I would say I am struggling with the GM in the way that I thought multiple times during Mod0 that I was not good enough and thought I would never learn, but looking back on it now I've learned so much in such a short time.
 - Inside my career and friends group I am known to everyone as the one people look up to, I have that GM, starting Turing, and the 40 hour prework.. I was consumed by a fixed mindset, which is opposite of how I normally live day to day.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
- A hash is a collection of data where each element of data is addressed by a name, it's like a modern dictionary.
- Difference is an array is an ordered array of items. An array has indexed positions.
- A hash is for matching some items to keys and values. A hash is unordered.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
- pet_store = {'dogfood' => 100, 'brush' => 5, 'shampoo' => 5, 'medicine' => 7, 'treats' => 500}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
- p "The value for IA is "#{states['IA']}"

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
- p states.keys
- p states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
- when you have to take 1 value and look up another value
- also better due to speed, looking up is faster.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
- why does some of my hash code print all in one line and then some print in a more readable format?
